As a user,

When I open the application, I want to ge greated with:
* A "Welcome" to what the application is and a brief description on how to begin.
* A "start" button 

Once I begin the application, I want to:
-See a timer on the display
-Add time for every (correct) answer ---> probably boolean
-Subtract time for every (wrong) answer ----> probably boolean
-See multiple choice questions
-See fill in the "blank" questions.
-Refresh the questions in random order if the user is playing again.

At the end of the application, I want to see:
-A tally of correct and incorrect answers
-Award the user "points" for every correct answer
-Allow the user to store their score (organized from highest to lowest)
-Allow the user to try again.

Variables:
1. The correct answers for the questions
