# code-quiz-challenge

## Objective

The goal with this challenge was to create a timed quiz that is able to store the user's highscores in local storage and display those scores to the user while using dynamically changing css and html.

## How I Achieved This

I began this assignment by creating some psuedo code for myself, so that I could begin to map out what I wanted to do or achieve with this challenge. I had a few ups and downs throughout this assignment and really had to push myself and put things back together once I tore them apart. I worked closely with other students as well as with my tutor help get me unstuck... which happened quite a bit. I am pretty happy with the end result and it seems to function accordinngly to the criteria for the challenge and how I envisioned it working.

## How This Applies To My Career

This challenge incorporated a lot of dynamic aspects and I think that is essential to modern-day applications. As a user, you want to navigate an app that is user friendly and responds accordingly to the user's choices and decisions. I really enjoyed the "game" aspect of this challenge and I look forward to experimenting more in that realm because the gaming side of the coding industry is packed-full of fun projects and career options.
